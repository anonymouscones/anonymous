## Fig. A3 More results on [Versatile Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08332)
### We chose to apply our method to Versatile Diffusion, a recent and influential work with official open source code and obtain good results on this model.

## Fig. A4 Failure cases
### We observe that attribution-binding and compositional capabilities of pretrained model are still considered major challenging issues, especially when involving multiple object and our model inherits these limitations.
